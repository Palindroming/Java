The differences between the two codes are summarized below.

## 1. **Difference in Role**.
- BoardEntity: **Entity model**, a class that is mapped to an actual database table using JPA.
- `BoardRequest`: **DTO (Data Transfer Object) model**, a data structure used to receive requests from clients.

## 2. Differences between Annotations
| Differences | `BoardEntity` (Entity) | `BoardRequest` (DTO) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JPA-specific annotations** | Use of `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Column` | None |
| **Validation checks** | None | Use `@NotBlank` (validates input) |
| Use `@JsonNaming(PropertyNamingStrategies.SnakeCaseStrategy.class)` (change the style of JSON field names) |

## 3.
- BoardEntity maps directly to a database table, so it is used for **DB storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion**.
- BoardRequest is used to validate and deliver data sent by the client when receiving HTTP requests.

## 4. Column differences
- BoardEntity contains the fields `id`, `boardName`, and `status`.
- BoardRequest contains only `boardName`, no id or status.

## 5. **Example of expected usage
- When a client creates a board, they pass request data via a `BoardRequest`.
- Server converts `BoardRequest` to `BoardEntity` and stores it in DB.

```java
// Example usage in the controller
@PostMapping(‚Äú/board‚Äù)
public ResponseEntity<BoardEntity> createBoard(@RequestBody @Valid BoardRequest boardRequest) {
    BoardEntity boardEntity = BoardEntity.builder()
            .boardName(boardRequest.getBoardName())
            .status(‚ÄúACTIVE‚Äù) // Set the default status
            .build();

    boardRepository.save(boardEntity);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(boardEntity);
}
```

### üìå **Conclusion**.
- A `BoardEntity` is an **entity mapped to a DB table**.
- A `BoardRequest` is a DTO for processing client requests.
- BoardRequest contains validation and JSON field conversion, and is not directly affected by the database.

In other words, **Entity is used for storing data and DTO is used for passing data**!
