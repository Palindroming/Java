Okay, so explain the overall structure, so I understand that entity is connected to db, repository is connected to service, which is connected to apicontroller, but what does dto do here?


---

        Okay, so you understand the overall structure and you're wondering what the DTO does.  
First, let's recap the overall flow and see **where the DTO's role comes into play**.

---.

## 1️⃣ **Overall application structure**.
Below is the basic structure of a Spring Boot application.

```
[Client (Frontend)]
       ↓ (HTTP Request - JSON Data)
[API Controller] → [Service] → [Repository] → [Database]
       ↑ (HTTP Response - JSON data)
[Client (Frontend)]
```

Role of each component:
- **Entity**: an object that maps 1:1 with a DB table (`@Entity`).
- Repository**: Layer that communicates with the DB using JPA (`@Repository`)
- Service: A layer that handles business logic (`@Service`)
- API Controller**: Layer that handles requests from clients (`@RestController`)
- DTO**: Objects responsible for sending and receiving data to and from the client.

---.

## 2️⃣ **What is the role of a DTO?
### ✅ **1. Only used to send and receive data**.
DTOs only **transform and pass data**.  
This means that they are **not directly connected to the DB** and are only used to pass data between the client (frontend) and the service tier.

💡 **This means that there is no logic to store or change data, it only processes and passes data.**

---.

## 3️⃣ **Why do we need DTOs?
### ✨ **(1) Why shouldn't we expose entities directly**?
When clients send and receive data, why can't they use `Entity` directly?

```java
// (bad example - using Entity directly)
@PostMapping(“/board”)
public ResponseEntity<BoardEntity> createBoard(@RequestBody BoardEntity boardEntity) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(boardRepository.save(boardEntity));
}
```
😨 **Problem**:
- Client may change the values of `id`, `status`, etc. at will → **Security issue**.
- When the DB structure changes, the frontend is affected → **Difficult to maintain**.
- Different JSON field names and entity field names may require conversion (`board_name` ↔ `boardName`)

To solve these problems, **use DTOs in the middle**.

---]

### ✨ **(2) There are many advantages of using DTOs**.
#### ✅ **Improved security**.
- Prevents clients from manipulating fields like `id` and `status`.

#### ✅ **Easier to convert data
- Entity field names (`boardName`) and JSON field names (`board_name`) can be easily converted.

#### ✅ **Deliver only the right data for your service**.
- Doesn't have to be 100% identical to the entity. You can exclude fields you don't need and add additional fields.

#### ✅ **Can be validated**.
- You can add validations like `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, etc. to ensure that the API only receives the correct data.

---]

## 4️⃣ **Correct API structure using DTOs**.
### ✅ **1. DTO class** **DTO class
```java
@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
@JsonNaming(value = PropertyNamingStrategies.SnakeCaseStrategy.class)
public class BoardRequest {
    
    @NotBlank // Don't accept empty values
    private String boardName;
}
```

### ✅ **2. Controller (using DTO)** **.
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(“/board”)
public class BoardController {

    private final BoardService boardService;

    public BoardController(BoardService boardService) {
        this.boardService = boardService;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<BoardEntity> createBoard(@RequestBody @Valid BoardRequest boardRequest) {
        BoardEntity board = boardService.createBoard(boardRequest);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(board);
    }
}
````
📌 **The controller receives and uses the DTO, it doesn't receive the Entity directly!**

---]

### ✅ **3. Service Layer (DTO → Entity conversion)**
```java
@Service
public class BoardService {

    private final BoardRepository boardRepository;

    public BoardService(BoardRepository boardRepository) {
        this.boardRepository = boardRepository;
    }

    public BoardEntity createBoard(BoardRequest request) {
        BoardEntity board = BoardEntity.builder()
                .boardName(request.getBoardName()) // DTO → Entity conversion
                .status(“ACTIVE”) // set default status value
                .build();
        return boardRepository.save(board);
    }
}
````
📌 **This structure takes a DTO, converts it to an Entity, and saves it to the Repository.**

---]

## 5️⃣ **Recap: Where are DTOs used?
| Hierarchy | Roles |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | Directly connected to DB table (`@Entity`) |
| **Repository** | Stores, retrieves, and deletes data from DB (`JpaRepository`) |
| **Service** | Handles business logic, converts DTO to Entity |
| **Controller** | Processes API requests, receives and uses DTOs |
| **DTO** | Object for passing data between Controller ↔ Service |

**📌 DTOs are used when passing data from the Controller to the Service, or when returning a response to the client.**

---]

## 🔥 **Completion**
### 🚀 **One Line Summary**.
**A DTO is a dedicated object used to pass data back and forth between the client and server, while protecting the entity!**

---.
### **💡 Most important points** **1.
1. **Direct use of Entity causes security/maintenance issues** → Use of DTO is essential!
2. **DTO is only responsible for data transfer, no business logic** 3.
3. **Use it for data exchange between Controller ↔ Service** 4.
4. **DTO can convert when JSON field names and Entity field names are different** 5.
5. can filter out invalid data through validation (`@NotBlank`, etc.)

In other words, DTOs can be understood as “a bridge for secure and flexible data delivery”!
